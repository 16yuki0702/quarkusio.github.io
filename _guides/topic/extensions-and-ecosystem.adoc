== Extensions and Ecosystem

One of the main goals of Quarkus is ease of extensibility. This will allow 3rd party projects to easily
take advantage of the work we have done to make it easier to target GraalVM. We provide a simple injection
based API to control how Substrate treats your library, including an easy way to register items for reflection
with no JSON files in sight.

We are also aiming to provide a support for a full extension ecosystem, to make it easy to discover and consume
3rd party extensions, as well as providing easier version management.
